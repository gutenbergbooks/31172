<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>These selections from Old English poetry have been
translated to meet the needs of that ever-increasing
body of students who cannot read the poems in their
original form, but who wish nevertheless to enjoy to
some extent the heritage of verse which our early
English ancestors have left for us. Especially in the
rapid survey of English literature given in most of
our colleges, a collection of translations covering the
Anglo-Saxon period and reflecting the form and spirit
of the original poems should add much to a fuller
appreciation of the varied and rich, though uneven,
literary output of our earliest singers.</p>
<p>In subject-matter these Old English poems are full
of the keenest interest to students of history, of customs,
of legend, of folk-lore, and of art. They form
a truly national literature; so that one who has read
them all has learned much not only of the life of the
early English, but of the feelings that inspired these
folk, of their hopes, their fears, and their superstitions,
of their whole outlook on life. They took their poetry
seriously, as they did everything about them, and
often in spite of crudity of expression, of narrow
vision, and of conventionalized modes of speech, this
very &ldquo;high seriousness&rdquo; raises an otherwise mediocre
poem to the level of real literature. Whatever may
<span class="pb" id="pg_6">[6]</span>
be said of the limitations of Old English poetry, of
its lack of humor, of the narrow range of its sentiments,
of the imitativeness of many of its most representative
specimens, it cannot be denied the name of
real literature; for it is the direct expression of the
civilization that gave it birth&mdash;a civilization that we
must understand if we are to appreciate the characteristics
of its more important descendants of our own
time.</p>
<p>Although the contents of these poems can be satisfactorily
studied in any translation, the effect of the
peculiar meter that reinforces the stirring spirit
of Old English poetry is lost unless an attempt is made
to reproduce this metrical form in the modern English
rendering. The possibility of retaining the original
meter in an adequate translation was formerly the
subject of much debate, but since Professor Gummere&rsquo;s
excellent version of <i>Beowulf</i> and the minor epic
poems,<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup>
and other recent successful translations of poems in the
Old English meter, there can be no question of the possibility
of putting Anglo-Saxon poems into readable
English verse that reproduces in large measure the
effect of the original. To do this for the principal Old
English poems, with the exception of <i>Beowulf</i>, is the
purpose of the present volume.</p>
<p>Except for the subtlest distinctions between the types
of half verse, strict Old English rules for the alliterative
meter have been adhered to. These rules may be
stated as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_7">[7]</div>
<p>1. The lines are divided into two half-lines, the division
being indicated by a space in the middle.</p>
<p>2. The half-lines consist of two accented and a varying
number of unaccented syllables. Each half-line
contains at least four syllables. Occasional half-lines
are lengthened to three accented syllables, possibly
for the purpose of producing an effect of solemnity.</p>
<p>3. The two half-lines are bound together by beginning-rime
or alliteration; <i>i.e.</i>, an agreement in sound
between the beginning letters of any accented syllables
in the line. For example, in the line</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>G</i>uthhere there <i>g</i>ave me <span class="hst">a <i>g</i>oodly jewel</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the <i>g</i>&rsquo;s form the alliteration. The third accent sets
the alliteration for the line and is known as the &ldquo;rime-giver.&rdquo;
With it agree the first and the second accent, or
either of them. The fourth accent must not, however,
agree with the rime-giver. Occasionally the first and
third accents will alliterate together and the second
and fourth, as,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">The <i>w</i>eary in <i>h</i>eart <span class="hst">against <i>W</i>yrd has no <i>h</i>elp;</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or the first and fourth may have the alliteration on
one letter, while the second and third have it on
another, as,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Then <i>h</i>eavier <i>g</i>rows <span class="hst">the <i>g</i>rief of his <i>h</i>eart.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These two latter forms are somewhat unusual. The
standard line is that given above:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>G</i>uthhere there <i>g</i>ave me <span class="hst">a <i>g</i>oodly jewel,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_8">[8]</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">A <i>h</i>undred generations; <span class="hst"><i>h</i>oary and stained with red,</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">With rings of <i>g</i>old <span class="hst">and <i>g</i>ilded cups.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All consonants alliterate with themselves, though
usually <i>sh</i>, <i>sp</i>, and <i>st</i> agree only with the same combination.
Vowels alliterate with one another.</p>
<p>In the following passage the alliterating letters are indicated
by italics:
</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then a <i>b</i>and of <i>b</i>old knights <span class="hst"><i>b</i>usily gathered,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><i>K</i>een men at the <i>c</i>onflict; <span class="hst">with <i>c</i>ourage they stepped forth,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><i>B</i>earing <i>b</i>anners, <span class="hst"><i>b</i>rave-hearted companions,</span></p>
<p class="t0">And <i>f</i>ared to the <i>f</i>ight, <span class="hst"><i>f</i>orth in right order,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><i>H</i>eroes under <i>h</i>elmets <span class="hst">from the <i>h</i>oly city</span></p>

<p>Besides the distinctive meter in which the Old English
poems are written, there are several qualities of
<span class="pb" id="pg_9">[9]</span>
style for which they are peculiar. No one can read
a page of these poems without being struck by the
parallel structure that permeates the whole body of
Old English verse. Expressions are changed slightly
and repeated from a new point of view, sometimes with
a good effect but quite as often to the detriment of
the lines. These parallelisms have been retained in the
translation in so far as it has been possible, but sometimes
the lack of inflectional endings in English has
prevented their literal translation.</p>
<p>Accompanying these parallelisms, and often a part of
them, are the frequent synonyms so characteristic of
Old English poetry. These synonymous expressions are
known as &ldquo;kennings.&rdquo; They are not to be thought
of as occasional metaphors employed at the whim of
the poet; they had, in most cases, already received
a conventional meaning. Thus the king was always
spoken of as &ldquo;ring giver,&rdquo; &ldquo;protector of earls,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bracelet bestower.&rdquo; The queen was the &ldquo;weaver of
peace&rdquo;; the sea the &ldquo;ship road,&rdquo; or &ldquo;whale path,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;gannet&rsquo;s bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old English poetry is conventionalized to a remarkable
degree. Even those aspects of nature that the
poets evidently enjoyed are often described in the
most conventional of words and phrases. More than half of so fine
a poem as <a href="#c42"><i>The Battle of Brunnanburg</i></a>
is taken bodily from other poems. No description of
a battle was complete without a picture of the birds
of prey hovering over the field. Heroes were always
assembling for banquets and receiving rewards of
<span class="pb" id="pg_10">[10]</span>
rings at the hand of the king. These conventional
phrases and situations, added to a thorough knowledge
of a large number of old Germanic myths, constituted
a great part of the equipment of the typical Old English
minstrel or scop, such as one finds described in
<a href="#c01"><i>Widsith</i></a> or
<a href="#c02"><i>Deor&rsquo;s Lament</i></a>.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that
the poems are convention and nothing more. A sympathetic
reading will undoubtedly show many high
poetic qualities. Serious and grave these poems
always are, but they do express certain of the darker
moods with a sincerity and power that is far from
commonplace. At times they give vivid glimpses of
the spirit of man under the blighting influence of the
&ldquo;dark ages.&rdquo; After reading these poems, we come to
understand better the pessimistic mood of the author
of <a href="#c22"><i>The Wanderer</i></a> when he says,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">All on earth is <span class="hst">irksome to man.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And we see how the winsome meadows of the land of
the <a href="#c40">Ph&oelig;nix</a> must by their contrast have delighted the
souls of men who were harassed on every side as our
ancestors were.</p>
<p>All of these distinguishing features of Old English
poetry&mdash;the regular alliterative meter, the frequent
parallelisms, the &ldquo;kennings,&rdquo; and the general dark
outlook on life will be found illustrated in the poems
selected in this book. They cover the entire period of
Old English literature and embrace every &ldquo;school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order in which the poems are printed is in no
<span class="pb" id="pg_11">[11]</span>
sense original, but is that followed in most standard textbooks.
Naturally such artificial divisions as &ldquo;Pagan&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; are inexact. The &ldquo;pagan&rdquo;
poems are only <i>largely</i> pagan; the &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;
predominatingly Christian. On the whole, the grouping
is perhaps accurate enough for practical purposes, and
the conformity to existing textbooks makes the volume
convenient for those who wish to use it to supplement
these books.</p>
<p>In addition to the poems, four short prose passages
referred to by most historians of the literature have
been included so as to add to the usefulness of the
volume.</p>
<p>In the translation of the poems the original meaning
and word-order has been kept as nearly as modern
English idiom and the exigencies of the meter would
allow. Nowhere, we believe, has the possibility of an
attractive alliteration caused violence to be done to
the sense of the poem.</p>
<p>The best diction to be used in such a translation is
difficult to determine. The temptation is ever present
to use the modern English descendant of the Anglo-Saxon
word, even when it is very archaic in flavor.
This tendency has been resisted, for it was desired to
reproduce the effect of the original; and, though Old
English poetry was conventional, it was probably not
archaic: it was not out of date at the time it was
written. Since the diction of these poems was usually
very simple, it has been the policy of the translators
to exclude all sophisticated expressions, and to retain
<span class="pb" id="pg_12">[12]</span>
words of Germanic origin or simple words of Latin
derivation that do not suggest subtleties foreign to the
mind of the Old English poet.</p>
<p>The texts used as a standard for translation are
indicated in the introductory notes to the different
poems. Whenever a good critical edition of a poem
has been available, it has been followed. Variations
from the readings used in these texts are usually indicated
where they are of any importance. In the
punctuation and paragraphing of the poems, the varying
usage of the different editors has been disregarded
and a uniform practice adopted throughout.</p>
<p>Following these principles, the translators have
attempted to reproduce for modern English readers
the meaning and movement of the Old English originals.
It is their earnest hope that something of the
fine spirit that breathes through much of this poetry
will be found to remain in the translation.</p>

<h3>1. EPIC OR HEROIC GROUP</h3>
<div id="c01" title="Widsith">
<h4>WIDSITH</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Critical edition: R. W. Chambers, <i>Widsith: a Study in Old English
Heroic Legend</i>. Cambridge, 1912.</p>
<p>Date: Probably late sixth or early seventh century.</p>
<p>Alliterative translation: Gummere, <i>Oldest English Epic</i> (1910), p. 191.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Widsith&mdash;&lsquo;Farway&rsquo;&mdash;the ideal wandering minstrel, tells of all the
tribes among whom he has sojourned, of all the chieftains he has known.
The first English students of the poem regarded it as autobiographical, as
the actual record of his wanderings written by a <i>scop</i>; and were inclined
to dismiss as interpolations passages mentioning princes whom it was
chronologically impossible for a man who had met Ermanric to have
known. This view was reduced to an absurdity by Haigh.</p>
<p class="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more we study the growth of German heroic tradition, the more
clear does it become that <i>Widsith</i> and <i>Deor</i> reflect that tradition. They
are not the actual outpourings of actual poets at the court of Ermanric
or the Heodenings. What the poems sung in the court of Ermanric were
like we shall never know: but we can safely say that they were unlike
<i>Widsith</i>.... The Traveller&rsquo;s tale is a fantasy of some man, keenly
interested in the old stories, who depicts an ideal wandering singer, and
makes him move hither and thither among the tribes and the heroes whose
stories he loves. In the names of its chiefs, in the names of its tribes,
and above all in its spirit, <i>Widsith</i> reflects the heroic age of the migrations,
an age which had hardly begun in the days of Ermanric.&rdquo;&mdash;Chambers,
p. 4.</p>
<p>Lines 75, 82-84 are almost certainly interpolated. With these
rejected &ldquo;the poem leaves upon us,&rdquo; says Chambers,
&ldquo;a very definite impression. It is a catalogue of the tribes
and heroes of Germany, and many of these heroes, though they may
have been half legendary already to the writer of the poem, are
historic characters who can be dated with accuracy.&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;In the footnotes, no attempt is made to discuss peoples or persons
mentioned in this poem unless they are definitely known and are of importance
for an understanding of the meaning of the lines.</p>

He was a king of the Goths. After his death, about 375 A.D.,
he came to be known as the typical bad king, covetous, fierce, and cruel.
According to the Scandinavian form of the story, the king sends his son
and a treacherous councillor, Bikki (the Becca of <a href="#frc01_18">v. 19</a>)
to woo and bring
to the court the maiden Swanhild. Bikki urges the son to woo her for himself

Swanhild to be trampled to death by horses. Her brothers revenge her death
and wound the king. At this juncture the Huns attack him, and during

The <i>Burgundians</i> were originally an East Germanic tribe. During the second
and third centuries they were neighbors of the Goths and lived in the modern
Posen. Later they moved west, and finally threatened Gaul, where in the
middle of the fifth century they were defeated by the Roman general, Aetius.
Shortly afterward they were defeated by the Huns. The remnant settled in
Savoy, where they gradually recovered, and by the middle of the sixth century
became an important nation. <i>Gifica</i> (or Gibica) was traditionally spoken
of as an early king who ruled over the Burgundians while they were still
in the east, living as neighbors of the Goths on the Vistula.</div>

<div class="fndef" id="fdc01_21"><a href="#frc01_21">21, 22.</a> <i>Hagena, Heoden, Wada.</i> These heroes all belong to one myth-cycle,
which was told in Europe for many centuries. It is difficult to reconstruct
the story as it was known at the time <i>Widsith</i> was written, for it has received
many additions at the hands of subsequent writers. The essential parts of
the tale seem to be these: Heoden asks his servant, the sweet-singing Heorrenda,
for help in wooing Hild, the daughter of Hagena. Heorrenda, enlisting
the services of Wada, the renowned sea-monster (or sea-god) goes to
woo Hild. By means of Wada&rsquo;s frightful appearance and skill in swordsmanship
they attract Hild&rsquo;s attention, and Heorrenda then sings so that the
birds are shamed into silence. They then woo Hild and flee with her from
her father&rsquo;s court. Hagena pursues, and Heoden, after marrying Hild, engages
him in battle. Each evening Hild goes to the battlefield and by magic
awakens the warriors who have fallen, and they fight the same battle over
day after day without ceasing. <i>Heorrenda</i>, the sweet singer of the Heodenings
(i.e., of the court of Heoden) is mentioned in
<i>Deor&rsquo;s Lament</i>, vv. <a href="#frc02_36">36 and 39</a>.
<i>Wada</i> is a widely-known legendary character. He had power over the sea.
He was the father of Weland, the Vulcan of Norse myth
(see <a href="#c02"><i>Deor&rsquo;s Lament</i></a>,
and <a href="#frc03_2"><i>Waldhere</i>, A, v. 2</a>).

toward the end of the fourth century. Legends of him are found in
Denmark and in England. Chambers concludes that the Danish form is perhaps
very near that known to the author of <i>Widsith</i>. Offa, the son of the
king, though a giant in stature, is dumb from his youth, and when the
German prince from the south challenges the aged king to send a champion
to defend his realm in single combat, Offa&rsquo;s speech is restored and he goes to
the combat. The fight was held at Fifeldore, the River Eider, which was along
the frontier between the Germans and the Danes. Here Offa fought against
two champions and defeated them both, thus establishing the frontier for
many years. Note that the author of <i>Widsith</i>, who is of the Myrging race,
is here celebrating the defeat of his own people.</div>

guardian of Hrothgar&rsquo;s son, thus bringing to an end his years of friendliness
to Hrothgar and his sons. The fight referred to is against Ingeld, Hrothgar&rsquo;s

Cambridge University Press, 1915, p. 70.</p>
<p>Alliterative translation: Gummere, <i>Oldest English Epic</i> (1910), p. 186.</p>
<p>The metrical arrangement of this poem into strophes with a constant
refrain is very unusual in the poetry of the Anglo-Saxons, though it is
common among their Scandinavian kinsmen. This fact has led some
scholars to believe that we have here a translation from the Old Norse.
Professor Gummere, however, makes a good case against this assumption.</p>
<p>The first three strophes refer to the widely known story of Weland, or
Wayland, the Vulcan of Norse myth. The crafty king, Nithhad, captures
Weland, fetters him (according to some accounts, hamstrings him),
and robs him of the magic ring that gives him power to fly. Beadohild,
Nithhad&rsquo;s daughter, accompanied by her brothers, goes to Weland and
has him mend rings for her. In this way he recovers his own ring and
his power to fly. Before leaving he kills the sons of Nithhad, and,
stupefying Beadohild with liquor, puts her to shame.]</p>

<h4>WALDHERE</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Critical text and translation: Dickins, <i>Runic and Heroic Poems</i>, p. 56.</p>
<p>Date: Probably eighth century.</p>
<p>Information as to the story is found in a number of continental sources.
Its best known treatment is in a Latin poem, <i>Waltharius</i>, by Ekkehard of
St. Gall, dating from the first half of the tenth century. Ekkehard&rsquo;s
story is thus summarized in the <i>Cambridge History of English Literature</i>:
&ldquo;Alphere, king of Aquitaine, had a son named Waltharius, and Heriricus,
king of Burgundy, an only daughter named Hiltgund, who was betrothed
to Waltharius. While they were yet children, however, Attila, king of the
Huns, invaded Gaul, and the kings seeing no hope in resistance, gave
up their children to him as hostages, together with much treasure. Under
like compulsion treasure was obtained also from Gibicho, king of the
Franks, who sent as hostage a youth of noble birth named Hagano. In
Attila&rsquo;s service, Waltharius and Hagano won great renown as warriors,
but the latter eventually made his escape. When Waltharius grew up,
he became Attila&rsquo;s chief general; yet he remembered his old engagement
with Hiltgund. On his return from a victorious campaign he made a
great feast for the king and his court, and when all were sunk in their
drunken sleep, he and Hiltgund fled laden with much gold. On their
way home they had to cross the Rhine near Worms. There the king of
the Franks, Guntharius, the son of Gibicho, heard from the ferryman
of the gold they were carrying and determined to secure it. Accompanied
by Hagano and eleven other picked warriors, he overtook them
as they rested in a cave in the Vosges. Waltharius offered him a large
share of the gold in order to obtain peace; but the king demanded the
whole, together with Hiltgund and the horses. Stimulated by the promise
of great rewards, the eleven warriors now attacked Waltharius one
after another, but he slew them all. Hagano had tried to dissuade
Guntharius from the attack; but now, since his nephew was among the
slain, he formed a plan with the king for surprising Waltharius. On
the following day they both fell upon him after he had quitted his
stronghold, and, in the struggle that ensued, all three were maimed.
Waltharius, however, was able to proceed on his way with Hiltgund, and
the story ends happily with their marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both our fragments, which are found on two leaves in the Royal
Library at Copenhagen, refer to a time immediately before the final
encounter. The first is spoken by the lady; the second by the man. We
cannot tell how long this poem may have been. What we have may be
leaves from a long epic, or a short poem, or an episode in a long epic.]</p>

<h4>THE FIGHT AT FINNSBURG</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Edition used: Chambers, <i>Beowulf</i>, p. 158. See also Dickins, <i>Runic
and Heroic Poems</i>, p. 64.</p>
<p>Alliterative translation, Gummere, <i>Oldest English Epic</i>, p. 160.</p>
<p>The manuscript is now lost. We have only an inaccurate version
printed by Hickes at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Many
difficulties are therefore found in the text. For a good discussion of
the text, see an article by Mackie in <i>The Journal of English and Germanic
Philology</i>, xvi, 250.</p>
<p>This fragment belongs to the epic story of Finn which is alluded to
at some length in <i>Beowulf</i> (vv. 1068-1159). The saga can be reconstructed
in its broad outlines, though it is impossible to be sure of
details. One of the most puzzling of these details is the position in
which the &ldquo;Fight&rdquo; occurs. In the story are two fights, either one of
which may be the one described in the fragment. The weight of opinion
seems to favor the first conflict, that in which Hn&aelig;f is killed. As summarized
by M&ouml;ller, the Finn story is briefly as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finn, king of the Frisians, had carried off Hildeburh, daughter of
Hoc (<i>Beowulf</i>, v. 1076), probably with her consent. Her father Hoc
seems to have pursued the fugitives, and to have been slain in the fight
which ensued on his overtaking them. After the lapse of some twenty
years, Hoc&rsquo;s sons Hn&aelig;f and Hengest, were old enough to undertake the
duty of avenging their father&rsquo;s death. They make an inroad into Finn&rsquo;s
country and a battle takes place in which many warriors, among them
Hn&aelig;f and a son of Finn (1074, 1079, 1115), are killed. Peace is therefore
solemnly concluded, and the slain warriors are burnt (1068-1124).</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the year is too far advanced for Hengest to return home (1130 ff.),
he and those of his men who survive remain for the winter in the Frisian
country with Finn. But Hengest&rsquo;s thoughts dwell constantly on the
death of his brother Hn&aelig;f, and he would gladly welcome any excuse to
break the peace which had been sworn by both parties. His ill concealed
desire for revenge is noticed by the Frisians, who anticipate it by themselves
taking the initiative and attacking Hengest and his men whilst
they are sleeping in the hall. This is the night attack described in the
&ldquo;Fight.&rdquo; It would seem that after a brave and desperate resistance
Hengest himself falls in this fight at the hands of Hunlafing (1143),
but two of his retainers, Guthlaf and Oslaf, succeed in cutting their way
through their enemies and in escaping to their own land. They return
with fresh troops, attack and slay Finn, and carry his queen, Hildeburh,
off with them (1125-1159).&rdquo;&mdash;Wyatt, <i>Beowulf</i>, (1901), p. 145.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_35">[35]</div>
<p>Professor Gummere finds in the fragment an example bearing out his
theory of the development of the epic. &ldquo;The qualities which difference it
from <i>Beowulf</i>,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are mainly negative; it lacks sentiment,
moralizing, the leisure of the writer; it did not attempt probably to cover
more than a single event; and one will not err in finding it a fair type
of the epic songs which roving singers were wont to sing before lord and
liegeman in hall and which were used with more or less fidelity by makers
of complete epic poems.&rdquo;]</p>

<h4>CHARMS</h4>

<p>Critical edition and discussion of most of the charms: Felix Grendon,
<i>Journal of American Folk-lore</i>, xxii, 105 ff. See that article
for bibliography.</p>
<p>Grendon divides the charms into five classes:</p>

<dd>2. Herbal charms.</dd>
<dd>3. Charms for transferring disease.</dd>
<dd>4. Amulet charms.</dd>
<dd>5. Charm remedies.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These charms contain some of the most interesting relics of the old
heathen religion of the Anglo-Saxons incongruously mingled with
Christian practices. They were probably written down at so late a
time that the churchmen felt they could no longer do harm.]</p>

<h5>I. For Bewitched Land</h5>
<p><i>Here is the remedy by which thou mayst improve
thy fields if they will not produce well or if any evil
thing is done to them by means of sorcery or witchcraft:</i></p>
<p> <span class="pln">5</span> <i>Take at night, before daybreak, four pieces of turf
from the four corners of the land and mark the places
where they have stood. Take then oil and honey and
yeast and the milk of every kind of cattle that is on
that land and a piece of every kind of tree that is grown
<span class="pln">10</span> on that land, except hard wood, and a piece of every
kind of herb known by name, except burdock alone.
Then put holy water on these and dip it thrice in the
<span class="pb" id="pg_39">[39]</span>
base of the turfs and say these words:</i> Crescite, <i>grow</i>,
et multiplicamini, <i>and multiply</i>, et replete, <i>and fill</i>, terram,
<span class="pln">15</span> <i>this earth</i>, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
Sancti sint benedicti; <i>and</i> Pater Noster <i>as often as anything
else</i>.</p>
<p><i>Then carry the turfs to the church and have the priest
sing four masses over them and have the green sides
<span class="pln">20</span> turned toward the altar. Then bring them back before
sunset to the place where they were at first. Now make
four crosses of aspen and write on the end of each</i>
Matheus <i>and</i> Marcus <i>and</i> Lucas <i>and</i> Johannes. <i>Lay
the crosses on the bottom of each hole and then say</i>:
<span class="pln">25</span> Crux Matheus, crux Marcus, crux Lucas, crux Sanctus
Johannes. <i>Then take the sods and lay them on top and
say nine times the word</i> Crescite, <i>and the</i> Pater Noster

<h4>RIDDLES</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Critical editions: Wyatt, Tupper, and Trautmann. Wyatt (Boston,
1912, Belles Lettres edition) used as a basis for these translations. His
numbering is always one lower than the other editions, since he rejects
one riddle.</p>
<p>Date: Probably eighth century for most of them.</p>
<p>For translations of other riddles than those here given see Brooke,
<i>English Literature from the Beginning to the Norman Conquest</i>, Pancoast
and Spaeth, <i>Early English Poems</i>, and Cook and Tinker, <i>Selections
from Old English Poetry</i>.</p>
<p>There is no proof as to the authorship. There were probably one
hundred of them in the original collection though only about ninety are
left. Many of them are translations from the Latin. Some are true
folk-riddles and some are learned.</p>
<p>In the riddles we find particulars of Anglo-Saxon life that we cannot
find elsewhere. The <i>Cambridge History of English Literature</i> sums their
effect up in the following sentence: &ldquo;Furthermore, the author or authors
of the Old English riddles borrow themes from native folk-songs and
saga; in their hands inanimate objects become endowed with life and
personality; the powers of nature become objects of worship such as they
were in olden times; they describe the scenery of their own country, the
fen, the river, and the sea, the horror of the untrodden forest, sun and
moon engaged in perpetual pursuit of each other, the nightingale and the
swan, the plow guided by the &lsquo;gray-haired enemy of the wood,&rsquo; the bull
breaking up clods left unturned by the plow, the falcon, the arm-companion
of &aelig;thelings&mdash;scenes, events, characters familiar in the England
of that day.&rdquo;]</p>

The poem is typical of a large group of Old English poems which give
well-known sayings or proverbs. Other poems of this group are <i>The
Gifts of Men</i>, <i>The Wonders of Creation</i>, <i>A Father&rsquo;s Instructions to His

<p class="t0">In a foreign country <span class="hst">far from my kinsmen.</span></p>

<p class="t0">The sea-birds bathing <span class="hst">and beating their wings,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Frost and snow falling <span class="hst">with freezing hail.</span></p>
<p class="t">Then heavier grows <span class="hst">the grief of his heart,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">50 </span>Sad after his dream; <span class="hst">he sorrows anew.</span></p>

<p>Up to line 65 this is one of the finest specimens of Anglo-Saxon poetry.
It expresses as few poems in English have done the spirit of adventure,
the <i>wanderlust</i> of springtime. The author was a remarkable painter
of the sea and its conditions. From line 65 to the end the poem consists
of a very tedious homily that must surely be a later addition.</p>
<p>The use of the first person throughout and the opposing sentiments
expressed have caused several scholars to consider the first part of the
poem a dialogue between a young man eager to go to sea and an old
sailor. The divisions of the speeches suggested have been as follows:</p>
<table class="wide">
<tr><td> (By H&ouml;nncher)  </td><td>   (By Kluge)    </td><td>  (By Rieger)</td></tr>
<tr><td> 1-33a  Sailor  </td><td>1-33 Sailor        </td><td>1-38a Sailor</td></tr>
<tr><td> 33b-38 Youth   </td><td>34-64 or 66 Youth  </td><td>33b-38 Youth</td></tr>
<tr><td> 39-43 Sailor   </td><td>                   </td><td>39-47 Sailor</td></tr>
<tr><td> 44-52 Youth    </td><td>                   </td><td>48-52 Youth</td></tr>
<tr><td> 53-57 Sailor   </td><td>                   </td><td>53-57 Sailor</td></tr>
<tr><td> 58-64a Youth   </td><td>                   </td><td>58-71 Youth</td></tr>
<tr><td>                </td><td>                   </td><td>71-end Sailor</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Sweet, in his <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>, objects to these theories since
there are not only no headings or divisions in the manuscript to indicate
such divisions, but there are no breaks or contrasts in the poem itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we discard these theories,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the simplest view of the
poem is that it is the monologue of an old sailor who first describes the
hardships of the seafaring life, and then confesses its irresistible attraction,
which he justifies, as it were, by drawing a parallel between the
seafarer&rsquo;s contempt for the luxuries of the life on land on the one hand
and the aspirations of a spiritual nature on the other, of which the sea
bird is to him the type. In dwelling on these ideals the poet loses sight
of the seafarer and his half-heathen associations, and as inevitably rises
to a contemplation of the cheering hopes of a future life afforded by Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dullness and obscurity of the last part of the poem, however, and
the obvious similarity to the homilies of the time make it very unlikely
that the whole poem was written by one author.]</p>

<h4>THE HUSBAND&rsquo;S MESSAGE</h4>

<p>[Text used: Kluge, <i>Angels&auml;chsisches Lesebuch</i>.</p>
<p>The piece of wood on which the message is written speaks throughout
the poem. It is impossible to tell whether the sender of the message is
husband or lover of the woman addressed.</p>
<p>Some scholars consider the
<a href="#c19">riddle on &ldquo;The Reed,&rdquo; number LX</a>, as the
true beginning of this poem. It precedes the &ldquo;Message&rdquo; in the manuscript.
Hicketeir (<i>Anglia</i>, xi, 363) thinks that it does not belong with
that riddle, but that it is itself a riddle. He cites the Runes, in lines
51-2, especially as evidence. Trautmann (<i>Anglia</i> xvi, 207) thinks that it
is part of a longer poem, in which the puzzling relation would be straightened
out.]</p>

<p>[Concerning the man C&aelig;dmon, we have nothing but Bede&rsquo;s account in
his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> (see <a href="#c44">p. 179 below</a>)
and C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Hymn.</p>
<p><i>Genesis</i> was first published in Amsterdam 1655, next in 1752. The first
editions brought <i>Genesis</i> under C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s name, because of Bede&rsquo;s
account. There is, however, no such clue in the manuscript. The assignment
of <i>Genesis</i> to C&aelig;dmon was questioned by Hicks as early as 1689.
The C&aelig;dmonian authorship was defended in the early part of the nineteenth
century by Conybeare and Thorpe. It is now agreed that all the
C&aelig;dmonian Paraphrases are probably by different authors.</p>

<p>This poem was attributed to Bede, who died in 735, by his pupil,
Cuthbert, who translated it into Latin. The Northumbrian version is
in a manuscript at St. Gall.</p>
<p>These verses are examples of gnomic poetry, which was very popular
in Old English literature. Miss Williams, in her <i>Gnomic Poetry in
Anglo-Saxon</i> (Columbia University Press, 1914), p. 67, says that
this is the earliest gnomic expression in Old English for which a
definite date may be set.</p>

<p class="t0">His trusted servant; <span class="hst">tried him sorely</span></p>
<p class="t0">To learn if his love <span class="hst">was lasting and certain.</span></p>
<p class="t0">With strongest words <span class="hst">he sternly said to him:</span></p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Hear me and hasten <span class="hst">hence, O Abraham.</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2850 </span>As thou leavest, lead <span class="hst">along with thee</span></p>
<p class="t0">Thy own child Isaac! <span class="hst">As an offering to me</span></p>
<p class="t0">Thyself shalt sacrifice <span class="hst">thy son with thy hands.</span></p>
<p class="t0">When thy steps have struggled <span class="hst">up the steep hill-side,</span></p>

<p class="t">He delayed not his going, <span class="hst">but began at once</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2860 </span>To prepare for departure: <span class="hst">he was compelled to obey</span></p>
<p class="t0">The angel of the Lord, <span class="hst">and he loved his God.</span></p>
<p class="t0">And then the faultless <span class="hst">father Abraham</span></p>
<p class="t0">Gave up his night&rsquo;s rest; <span class="hst">he by no means failed</span></p>
<p class="t0">To obey the Lord&rsquo;s bidding, <span class="hst">but the blessed man</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2865 </span>Girded his gray sword, <span class="hst">God&rsquo;s spirit he showed</span></p>
<p class="t0">That he bore in his breast. <span class="hst">His beasts then he fed,</span></p>
<p class="t0">This aged giver of gold. <span class="hst">To go on the journey</span></p>
<p class="t0">Two young men he summoned: <span class="hst">his son made the third;</span></p>
<p class="t0">He himself was the fourth. <span class="hst">He set forward eagerly</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2870 </span>From his own home <span class="hst">and Isaac with him,</span></p>
<p class="t0">The child ungrown, <span class="hst">as charged by his God.</span></p>
<p class="t0">Then he hurried ahead <span class="hst">and hastened forth</span></p>

<p class="t0">Arose in radiance. <span class="hst">Then the righteous man</span></p>

<div class="pb" id="pg_87">[87]</div>

<p class="t0">Which the Sovereign of souls <span class="hst">has assigned us to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="t">The old man ascended <span class="hst">with his own son</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2885 </span>To the place which the Lord <span class="hst">had appointed for them,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Went through the wealds; <span class="hst">the wood Isaac carried&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="t0">His father the fire and the sword. <span class="hst">Then first inquired</span></p>
<p class="t0">The boy young in winters, <span class="hst">in these words of Abraham:</span></p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Fire and sword, my father, <span class="hst">we find here ready:</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2890 </span>Where is the glorious offering <span class="hst">which to God on the altar</span></p>
<p class="t0">Thou thinkest to bring <span class="hst">and burn as a sacrifice?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="t">Abraham answered <span class="hst">(he had only one thing</span></p>
<p class="t0">That he wished to perform, <span class="hst">the will of the Father):</span></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Sovereign of all <span class="hst">himself shall find it,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2895 </span>As the Lord of men <span class="hst">shall believe to be meet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="t0">Up the steep hill struggled <span class="hst">the stout-hearted man,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Leading the child <span class="hst">as the Lord had charged,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Till climbing he came <span class="hst">to the crest of the height,</span></p>
<p class="t0">To the place appointed <span class="hst">by the powerful Lord,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2900 </span>Following the commands <span class="hst">of his faithful Master.</span></p>
<p class="t">He loaded the altar <span class="hst">and lighted the fire,</span></p>
<p class="t0">And fettered fast <span class="hst">the feet and hands</span></p>
<p class="t0">Of his beloved son <span class="hst">and lifted upon it</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_88">[88]</div>
<p class="t0">The youthful Isaac, <span class="hst">and instantly grasped</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2905 </span>The sword by the hilt; <span class="hst">his son he would kill</span></p>
<p class="t0">With his hands as he promised <span class="hst">and pour on the fire</span></p>
<p class="t0">The gore of his kinsman. <span class="hst">&mdash;Then God&rsquo;s servant,</span></p>
<p class="t0">An angel of the Lord, <span class="hst">to Abraham loudly</span></p>
<p class="t0">Spoke with words. <span class="hst">He awaited in quiet</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2910 </span>The behests from on high <span class="hst">and he hailed the angel.</span></p>
<p class="t">Then forthwith spoke <span class="hst">from the spacious heavens</span></p>
<p class="t0">The messenger of God, <span class="hst">with gracious words:</span></p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Burn not thy boy, <span class="hst">O blessed Abraham,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Lift up the lad <span class="hst">alive from the altar;</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2915 </span>The God of Glory <span class="hst">grants him his life!</span></p>
<p class="t0">O man of the Hebrews, <span class="hst">as meed for thy obedience,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Through the holy hand <span class="hst">of heaven&rsquo;s King,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Thyself shall receive <span class="hst">a sacred reward,</span></p>

<p class="t">The altar still burned. <span class="hst">Abraham was blessed</span></p>

<h3>2. CYNEWULF AND HIS SCHOOL</h3>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Aside from C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s Hymn, the only Old English poems whose
author we know are four bearing the name of Cynewulf, <i>Christ</i>, <i>Juliana</i>,
<i>Elene</i>, and <i>The Fates of the Apostles</i>. In these he signs his name by
means of runes inserted in the manuscript. These runes, which are at once
letters of the alphabet and words, are made to fit into the context. They are
<img src="images/p95.png" alt="Anglo-Saxon runes: cen,yr,nyd,eoh,wynn,ur,lagu,feoh" title="Anglo-Saxon runes: cen,yr,nyd,eoh,wynn,ur,lagu,feoh" /></p>
<p>Several other poems have been ascribed to Cynewulf, especially
<i>Andreas</i>, <i>The Dream of the Rood</i>, <i>Guthlac</i>,
<i>The Ph&oelig;nix</i>, and <i>Judith</i>. Except for internal
evidence there is no proof of the authorship of these poems. The
Riddles were formerly thought to be by Cynewulf, but recent scholars
have, with one notable exception, abandoned that theory.</p>
<p>Many reconstructions of the life of Cynewulf have been undertaken.
The most reasonable theories seem to be that he was Cynewulf, Bishop of
Lindisfarne, who died about 781; or that he was a priest, Cynewulf, who
executed a decree in 803. There is no real proof that either of these men
was the poet. For a good discussion of the Cynewulf question, see Strunk,
<i>Juliana</i>, pp. xvii-xix, and Kennedy, <i>The Poems of Cynewulf</i>,
Introduction.</p>
<p>Of the signed poems of Cynewulf, selections are here given from
<i>Christ</i> and <i>Elene</i>.]</p>

<div id="c31" title="Selections from the Christ">
<h4>SELECTIONS FROM THE CHRIST</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Critical edition: Cook, <i>The Christ of Cynewulf</i>, Boston, 1900.
Text and translation: Gollancz, <i>Cynewulf&rsquo;s Christ</i>, London, 1892.
Translation: Kennedy, <i>The Poems of Cynewulf</i>, pp. 153, ff.
The poem consists of three parts:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Advent, largely from the Roman breviary.</dd>
<dd>2. Ascension, taken from an Ascension sermon of Pope Gregory.</dd>
<dd>3. Second coming of Christ, taken from an alphabetical Latin hymn
on the Last Judgment, quoted by Bede.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is there enough unity to make us consider it one work? Cook thinks
we can. The differences in the language and meter are not so striking as
to make it unlikely. The great objection to it is that the runes occur
at the end of the second part, which is not far from the middle of the
entire poem. In the three other poems signed by Cynewulf the runes occur
near the end.]</p>

<h3><i>b</i>. ANONYMOUS POEMS OF THE CYNEWULFIAN SCHOOL</h3>
<h4>THE DREAM OF THE ROOD</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Critical edition: Cook, <i>The Dream of the Rood</i>, Oxford, 1905.</p>
<p>Author: &ldquo;Making all due allowance, then, for the weakness of certain
arguments both pro and con, the balance of probability seems to incline
decidedly in favor of Cynewulfian authorship.&rdquo;&mdash;Cook.</p>
<p>Translations: English Prose: Kemble. Verse: Stephens, 1866;
Morley, 1888; Miss Iddings, 1902.</p>
<p>The poem has much in common with <i>Elene</i>, especially the intimate
self-analysis. Portions of it are on the Ruthwell Cross in Dumfriesshire.
It is claimed as Cynewulf&rsquo;s, but there is nothing to indicate this except
the beauty of style, which has caused it to be called &ldquo;the choicest
blossom of Old English Christian poetry.&rdquo;]</p>

<p class="t0">Then I lay and looked <span class="hst">for a long time</span></p>

<p class="t0">Until I heard it <span class="hst">lift high its voice.</span></p>
<p class="t0">The worthiest of the wood-race <span class="hst">formed words and spoke:</span></p>

<p>[Critical edition: Cook, <i>Judith</i>, Boston, 1904.</p>
<p>Translation: <i>Hall, Judith, Phoenix and Other Anglo-Saxon Poems.</i></p>
<p>Manuscript: The same as the one containing <i>Beowulf</i>. It was injured
by a fire in 1731. It had been printed by Thwaites in 1698 before the
injury.</p>
<p>Authorship and date: The mixture of dialect forms seems to indicate
that a northern original passed through one or more hands and that at
least the last scribe belonged to the late West Saxon period. Cook thinks
that it is not earlier than about 825 nor later than 937, and that it is
possibly by Cynewulf.</p>

appearance of being practically complete. Certainly, as it stands it makes
an artistic whole: we begin and end the poem by showing how Judith was
favored of God. Within a very short space after the opening lines we are
in the midst of the action: Judith has come from her beleaguered city of
Bethulia and enchanted Holofernes by her beauty, and Holofernes has finished
his great feast by summoning her to him. All this is put before us in the
first 37 lines. The rest of the poem is vividly conceived, from the slaying of
the Assyrian king to the final victory and rejoicing.</div>

<h4>THE PH&OElig;NIX</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Text used: Bright&rsquo;s <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>. The Latin source is also
printed there.</p>
<p>Alliterative translations: Pancoast and Spaeth, <i>Early English Poems</i>;
William Rice Sims, <i>Modern Language Notes</i>, vii, 11-13; Hall, <i>Judith</i>,
<i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>, etc.</p>
<p>Source: First part, Lactantius, <i>De Ave Phoenice</i>; second part, application
of the myth to Christ based on Ambrose and Bede.</p>
<p>In summing up scholarly opinion up to the date of his own writing
(1910) Mr. Kennedy says [<i>The Poems of Cynewulf</i>, pp. 58-59]: &ldquo;In
general, however, it may be said that, while the question does not submit
itself to definite conclusions, the weight of critical opinion leans to the
side of Cynewulf&rsquo;s having written the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>, and that the time of its
composition would fall between the <i>Christ</i> and the <i>Elene</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first part of the poem is among the most pleasing pieces of description
in Anglo-Saxon.]</p>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF BRUNNANBURG</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Critical edition: Sedgefield, <i>The Battle of Maldon and Six Short
Poems from the Saxon Chronicle</i>, Boston, 1904, Belles Lettres
Edition.</p>
<p>Translation: Tennyson; Pancoast and Spaeth, <i>Early English Poems</i>,
p. 81.</p>
<p>Date: It appears in the Chronicle under the year 937.</p>
<p>Danes living north of the Humber conspired with their kinsmen in
Ireland under the two Olafs, together with the Scottish king Constantine
and the Strathclyde Britons under their king Eugenius, against
&AElig;thelstan, king of Wessex. The allies met in the south of Northumbria.
&AElig;thelstan encountered them at Brunnanburg and defeated them.</p>
<p>The site of Brunnanburg has not been identified. The best claim is
probably for Bramber, near Preston, in the neighborhood of which, in
1840, was found a great hoard of silver ingots and coins, none later than
950. This was possibly the war chest of the confederacy. <i>Dyngesmere</i>
has not been identified.</p>

poems.]</p>

<h4>THE BATTLE OF MALDON</h4>
<div class="bq">
<p>[Critical edition: Sedgefield, <i>The Battle of Maldon and Six Short
Poems from the Saxon Chronicle</i>, Boston, 1904, Belles Lettres Edition.</p>
<p>Date: It appears in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 991.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Battle of Maldon</i> treats not of legendary heroes
of the Germanic races but of an actual historic personage, an English
hero and patriot fallen in battle against a foreign invader a very
short time before the poem was made. A single event in contemporary
history is here described with hardly suppressed emotion by one who
knew his hero and loved him. There is none of the allusiveness and
excursiveness of the  <i>Beowulf</i>; we have here not a member of
an epic cycle, but an independent song. Very striking is the absence
of ornament from the <i>Battle of Maldon</i>; all is plain, blunt,
and stern.&rdquo;&mdash;Sedgefield, <i>The Battle of Maldon</i>,
pp. vi-vii.]</p>

<p class="t0"><span class="vn">15 </span>His board and his broad sword; <span class="hst">his boast he made good,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Fearless to fight <span class="hst">before his lord.</span></p>
<p class="t">Then Byrhtnoth began <span class="hst">to embolden the warriors;</span></p>
<p class="t0">He rode and counseled them, <span class="hst">his comrades he taught</span></p>
<p class="t0">How they should stand <span class="hst">in the stronghold&rsquo;s defence,</span></p>

<p class="t"><span class="vn">25 </span>Then he stood on the strand; <span class="hst">sternly the messenger</span></p>

<p class="t0">It is better for you <span class="hst">to bargain with gold</span></p>
<p class="t0">Than that we should fiercely <span class="hst">fight you in battle.</span></p>
<p class="t0">It is futile to fight <span class="hst">if you fill our demands;</span></p>

<p class="t0">If commands thou wilt make, <span class="hst">who art mightiest of warriors,</span></p>
<p class="t0">That thy folk shall be free <span class="hst">from the foemen&rsquo;s attack,</span></p>

<p class="t0">Byrhtnoth burst forth, <span class="hst">his buckler he grasped,</span></p>
<p class="t0">His spear he seized, <span class="hst">and spoke in words</span></p>
<p class="t0">Full of anger and ire, <span class="hst">and answer he gave:</span></p>

<p class="t0">Spears they will send <span class="hst">to the sailors as tribute,</span></p>

<p class="t0">And such weapons of war <span class="hst">as shall win you no battles.</span></p>
<p class="t0">Envoy of Vikings, <span class="hst">your vauntings return,</span></p>

<p class="t0">For the realm of &AElig;thelred, <span class="hst">my royal chief,</span></p>

<p class="t0"><span class="vn">55 </span>The heathen at shield-play; <span class="hst">Shameful I deem it</span></p>

<p class="t0">Until they arrived <span class="hst">at the river bank.</span></p>

<p class="t0">By <a href="#fdc43_65">Panta&rsquo;s stream</a> <span class="hst">they stood in array,</span></p>

<p class="t0">On the bridge, the boldest <span class="hst">of the band of men.</span></p>
<p class="t0">There waited with Wulfstan <span class="hst">the warriors undaunted,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">80 </span>&AElig;lfhere and Maccus, <span class="hst">men of courage;</span></p>
<p class="t0">At the ford not a foot <span class="hst">would they flee the encounter,</span></p>

<p class="t0"><span class="vn">85 </span>How fiercely fought <span class="hst">was the defense of the bridge,</span></p>
<p class="t0">The treacherous tribe <span class="hst">in trickery asked</span></p>
<p class="t0">That they be allowed <span class="hst">to lead their hosts</span></p>
<p class="t0">For a closer conflict, <span class="hst">to cross over the ford.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_167">[167]</div>
<p class="t0">Then the earl, too eager <span class="hst">to enter the fight,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">90 </span>Allowed too much land <span class="hst">to the loathed pirates.</span></p>
<p class="t0">Clearly then called <span class="hst">over the cold water</span></p>
<p class="t0">Byrhthelm&rsquo;s son; <span class="hst">the soldiers listened:</span></p>

<p class="t"><span class="vn">100 </span>In ready array <span class="hst">against the raging hosts</span></p>
<p class="t0">Stood Byrhtnoth&rsquo;s band; <span class="hst">he bade them with shields</span></p>

<p class="t0"><span class="vn">120 </span>For his prowess the prince <span class="hst">gave praise and thanks</span></p>

<p class="t0">The point pierced home, <span class="hst">so that prostrate lay</span></p>
<p class="t0">The Viking whose valor <span class="hst">had vanquished the earl.</span></p>
<p class="t">To the earl then went <span class="hst">an armed warrior;</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">160 </span>He sought to snatch <span class="hst">and seize his rings,</span></p>
<p class="t0">His booty and bracelets, <span class="hst">his bright shining sword.</span></p>
<p class="t0">Byrhtnoth snatched forth <span class="hst">the brown-edged weapon</span></p>
<p class="t0">From his sheath, and sharply <span class="hst">shook the attacker;</span></p>
<p class="t0">Certain of the seamen <span class="hst">too soon joined against him,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">165 </span>As he checked the arm <span class="hst">of the charging enemy;</span></p>
<p class="t0">Now sank to the ground <span class="hst">his golden brand;</span></p>
<p class="t0">He might not hold <span class="hst">the hilt of his mace,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Nor wield his weapons. <span class="hst">These words still he spoke,</span></p>
<p class="t0">To embolden the youths; <span class="hst">the battle-scarred hero</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">170 </span>Called on his comrades <span class="hst">to conquer their foes;</span></p>
<p class="t0">He no longer had strength <span class="hst">to stand on his feet,</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_170">[170]</div>
<p class="t0">. &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . <span class="hst">he looked to heaven:</span></p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Ruler of realms, <span class="hst">I render thee thanks</span></p>
<p class="t0">For all of the honors <span class="hst">that on earth I have had;</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">175 </span>Now, gracious God, <span class="hst">have I greatest of need</span></p>
<p class="t0">That thou save my soul <span class="hst">through thy sovereign mercy,</span></p>

<p class="t0">And pass into thy power, <span class="hst">O Prince of angels,</span></p>
<p class="t0">And depart in peace; <span class="hst">this prayer I make,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">180 </span>That the hated hell-fiends <span class="hst">may harass me not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="t">Then the heathen dogs <span class="hst">hewed down the noble one,</span></p>

<p class="t0">They lost their lives <span class="hst">in their lord&rsquo;s defence.</span></p>
<p class="t"><span class="vn">185 </span>Then fled from the fray <span class="hst">those who feared to remain.</span></p>
<p class="t0">First in the frantic <span class="hst">flight was Godric,</span></p>
<p class="t0">The son of Odda; <span class="hst">he forsook his chief</span></p>
<p class="t0">Who had granted him gifts <span class="hst">of goodly horses;</span></p>
<p class="t0">Lightly he leapt <span class="hst">on his lord&rsquo;s own steed,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">190 </span>In its royal array <span class="hst">&mdash;no right had he to it;</span></p>
<p class="t0">His brothers also <span class="hst">the battle forsook.</span></p>
<p class="t0">Godwin and Godwy <span class="hst">made good their escape,</span></p>
<p class="t0">And went to the wood, <span class="hst">for the war they disliked;</span></p>
<p class="t0">They fled to the fastnesses <span class="hst">in fear of their lives,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">195 </span>And many more <span class="hst">of the men than was fitting,</span></p>
<p class="t0">Had they freshly in mind <span class="hst">remembered the favors,</span></p>
<p class="t0">The good deeds he had done them <span class="hst">in days of old.</span></p>

<p class="t0">&AElig;thelred&rsquo;s earl; <span class="hst">all his companions</span></p>

<p class="t0">The hardy heroes <span class="hst">hastened madly,</span></p>
<p class="t0">All of them eager <span class="hst">either to die</span></p>

<p class="t0">They were eagerly urged <span class="hst">by &AElig;lfric&rsquo;s son,</span></p>

<h2>APPENDIX&mdash;SELECTIONS FROM OLD ENGLISH PROSE</h2>
<div id="c44" title="Account of the Poet C&aelig;dmon">
<h4>ACCOUNT OF THE POET C&AElig;DMON</h4>
<p class="bq">[From the Anglo-Saxon version of Bede&rsquo;s <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.
Text used: Bright&rsquo;s <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>, pp. 8 ff.]</p>
<p>In the monastery of this abbess [Hild] was a certain
brother especially distinguished and gifted with the
grace of God, because he was in the habit of making
poems filled with piety and virtue. Whatever he learned
<span class="pln">5</span> of holy writ through interpreters he gave forth in a
very short time in poetical language with the greatest
of sweetness and inspiration, well wrought in the English
tongue. Because of his songs the minds of many
men were turned from the thoughts of this world and
<span class="pln">10</span> incited toward a contemplation of the heavenly life.
There were, to be sure, others after him among the
Angles who tried to compose sacred poetry, but none
of them could equal him; because his instruction in
poetry was not at all from men, nor through the aid of
<span class="pln">15</span> any man, but it was through divine inspiration and as
a gift from God that he received the power of song.
For that reason he was never able to compose poetry
of a light or idle nature, but only the one kind that pertained
to religion and was fitted to the tongue of a
<span class="pln">20</span> godly singer such as he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_180">[180]</div>
<p>This man had lived the life of a layman until he was
somewhat advanced in years, and had never learned
any songs. For this reason often at the banquets where
for the sake of merriment it was ruled that they should
<span class="pln">25</span> all sing in turn at the harp, when he would see the harp
approach him, he would arise from the company out of
shame and go home to his house. On one occasion he had
done this and had left the banquet hall and gone out to
the stable to the cattle which it was his duty to guard
<span class="pln">30</span> that night. Then in due time he lay down and slept, and
there stood before him in his dream a man who hailed
him and greeted him and called him by name: &ldquo;C&aelig;dmon,
sing me something.&rdquo; Then he answered and said:
&ldquo;I can not sing anything; and for that reason I left
<span class="pln">35</span> the banquet and came here, since I could not sing.&rdquo;
Once more the man who was speaking with him said:
&ldquo;No matter, you must sing for me.&rdquo; Then he answered:
&ldquo;What shall I sing?&rdquo; Thereupon the stranger said:
&ldquo;Sing to me of the beginning of things.&rdquo; When he had
<span class="pln">40</span> received this answer he began forthwith to sing, in
praise of God the Creator, verses and words that he had
never heard, in the following manner:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now shall we praise <span class="hst">the Prince of heaven,</span></p>
<p class="t0">The might of the Maker <span class="hst">and his manifold thought,</span></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">45 </span>The work of the Father: <span class="hst">of what wonders he wrought,</span></p>
<p class="t0">The Lord everlasting <span class="hst">when he laid out the worlds.</span></p>
<p class="t0">He first raised up <span class="hst">for the race of men</span></p>
<p class="t0">The heaven as a roof, <span class="hst">the holy Ruler.</span></p>
<p class="t0">Then the world below, <span class="hst">the Ward of mankind,</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_181">[181]</div>
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">50 </span>The Lord everlasting, <span class="hst">at last established</span></p>
<p class="t0">As a home for man, <span class="hst">the Almighty Lord.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Then he arose from his sleep, and all that he had
sung while asleep he held fast in memory; and soon
afterward he added many words like unto them befitting
<span class="pln">55</span> a hymn to God. The next morning he came to the steward
who was his master and told him of the gift he had
received. The steward immediately led him to the
abbess and related what he had heard. She bade assemble
all the wise and learned men and asked C&aelig;dmon to
<span class="pln">60</span> relate his dream in their presence and to sing the song
that they might give their judgment as to what it was
or whence it had come. They all agreed that it was a
divine gift bestowed from Heaven. They then explained
to him a piece of holy teaching and bade him if he could,
<span class="pln">65</span> to turn that into rhythmic verse. When he received
the instruction of the learned men, he departed for his
house. In the morning he returned and delivered the
passage assigned him, turned into an excellent poem.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the abbess, praising and honoring the
<span class="pln">70</span> gift of God in this man, persuaded him to leave the
condition of a layman and take monastic vows. And
this he did with great eagerness. She received him and
his household into the monastery and made him one of
the company of God&rsquo;s servants and commanded that he
<span class="pln">75</span> be taught the holy writings and stories. He, on his
part, pondered on all that he learned by word of mouth,
and just as a clean beast chews on a cud, transformed
it into the sweetest of poetry. His songs and poems
were so pleasing that even his teachers came to learn
<span class="pb" id="pg_182">[182]</span>
<span class="pln">80</span> and write what he spoke. He sang first of the creation
of the earth, and of the origin of mankind, and all the
story of Genesis, the first book of Moses; and afterwards
of the exodus of the Children of Israel from the
land of Egypt and the entry into the Promised Land;
<span class="pln">85</span> and many other stories of the Holy Scriptures; the incarnation
of Christ, and his suffering and his ascension
into heaven; the coming of the Holy Ghost and
the teaching of the apostles; and finally he wrote many
songs concerning the future day of judgment and of
<span class="pln">90</span> the fearfulness of the pains of hell, and the bliss of
heaven; besides these he composed many others concerning
the mercies and judgments of God. In all of
these he strove especially to lead men from the love of
sin and wickedness and to impel them toward the love
<span class="pln">95</span> and practice of righteousness; for he was a very pious
man and submissive to the rules of the monastery. And
he burned with zeal against those who acted otherwise.
For this reason it was that his life ended with a fair
death.</p>

<h4>ALFRED&rsquo;S PREFACE TO HIS TRANSLATION OF GREGORY&rsquo;S &ldquo;PASTORAL CARE&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="bq">[Text: Bright&rsquo;s <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>, pp. 26 ff.]</p>
<p>King Alfred sends greetings to W&aelig;rferth in loving
and friendly words. I let thee know that it has often
come to my mind what wise men there were formerly
throughout England among both the clergy and the
<span class="pln">5</span> laity, and what happy times there were then throughout
England, and how the kings who held sway over
the people in those days obeyed God and his ministers;
and how they preserved not only their peace but their
morality also and good order at home and extended
<span class="pln">10</span> their possessions abroad; and how prosperous they
were both with war and with wisdom; and how zealous
the clergy were both in teaching and in learning, and
in all the services they owed to God; and how foreigners
came to the land in search of wisdom and learning, and
<span class="pln">15</span> how we should now have to secure them from abroad if
we were to have them. So complete was this decay in
England that there were very few on this side of the
Humber who could understand their rituals in English
or translate a Latin letter into English; and I feel sure
<span class="pln">20</span> that there were not many beyond Humber. So few there
were that I can not remember a single one south of
the Thames when I began to reign. Almighty God be
<span class="pb" id="pg_184">[184]</span>
thanked that we have any teachers among us now....</p>
<p>Then I considered all this, and brought to mind
<span class="pln">25</span> also how, before it had all been laid waste and burned,
the churches throughout all England stood filled with
treasures and books; and there was a great multitude
of God&rsquo;s servants, but they knew very little about the
books, for they could not understand anything in them,
<span class="pln">30</span> since they were not written in their own language&mdash;as
if they spoke thus: &ldquo;Our fathers who held these places
of old loved wisdom and through it acquired wealth
and bequeathed it to us. Here we may still see their
tracks, but we can not follow them, and hence we have
<span class="pln">35</span> now lost both the wealth and the wisdom, since we
would not incline our hearts after their example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I called all this to mind, I wondered very much,
considering all the good and wise men who were formerly
throughout England and all the books that they
<span class="pln">40</span> had perfectly learned, that they had translated no part
of them into their own language. But soon I answered
myself and said: &ldquo;They did not expect that men should
ever become as careless and that learning should decay
as it has; they neglected it through the desire that the
<span class="pln">45</span> greater increase of wisdom there should be in the land
the more should men learn of foreign languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then considered that the law was first found in the
Hebrew tongue, and again when the Greeks learned it,
they translated it all into their own language. And the
<span class="pln">50</span> Romans likewise when they had learned it, they translated
it all through learned scholars into their own language.
And all other Christian people have turned
<span class="pb" id="pg_185">[185]</span>
some part into their own language. Wherefore it seems
to me best, if it seems so to you, that we should translate
<span class="pln">55</span> some books that are most needful for all men to
know into the language which we can all understand
and that we should bring about what we may very
easily do with God&rsquo;s help if we have tranquillity;
namely, that all youths that are now in England of
<span class="pln">60</span> free birth, who are rich enough to devote themselves
to it, be put to learning as long as they are not fitted
for any other occupation, until the time that they shall
be able to read English writing with ease: and let those
that would pursue their studies further be taught more
<span class="pln">65</span> in Latin and be promoted to a higher rank. When I
brought to mind how the knowledge of Latin had formerly
decayed throughout England, and yet many knew
how to read English writing, I began among other
various and manifold troubles of this kingdom to turn
<span class="pln">70</span> into English the book that is called in Latin <i>Pastoralis</i>
and in English <i>The Shepherd&rsquo;s Book</i>, sometimes word
for word, sometimes thought by thought, as I had
learned it from Plegmund my archbishop, and Asser
my bishop, and Grimbald my priest, and John my priest.
<span class="pln">75</span> After I had learned it so that I understood it and so
that I could interpret it clearly, I translated it into
English. I shall send one copy to every bishopric in
my kingdom; and in each is a book-mark worth fifty
mancuses. And I command in God&rsquo;s name that no man
<span class="pln">80</span> take the book-mark from the monastery. It is not certain
that there will be such learned bishops as, thanks
be to God, we now have nearly everywhere. Hence
<span class="pb" id="pg_186">[186]</span>
I wish the books to remain always in their places, unless
the bishop wishes to take them with him, or they be lent
<span class="pln">85</span> out anywhere, or any one be copying them.</p>

<h4>THE CONVERSION OF EDWIN.</h4>
<p class="bq">[From Alfred&rsquo;s translation of Bede&rsquo;s
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>. Text: Bright, <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>,
p. 62, line 2&mdash;p. 63, line 17.]</p>
<p>When the king heard these words, he answered him [Paulinus,
who had been preaching Christianity to him] and said that he
was not only willing but expected to accept the faith that he
taught; the king said, however,
<span class="pln">5</span> that he wished to have speech and counsel with
his friends and advisers, so that if they accepted the
faith with him they might all together be consecrated
to Christ, the Fountain of Life. The bishop consented
and the king did as he said.</p>
<p> <span class="pln">10</span> He now counselled and advised with his wise men,
and he asked of each of them separately what he thought
of the new doctrine and the worship of God that was
preached. Cefi, the chief of his priests, then answered,
&ldquo;Consider, oh king, what this teaching is that is now
<span class="pln">15</span> delivered to us. I declare to you, I have learned for a
certainty that the religion we have had up to the present
has neither virtue nor usefulness in it. For none of
thy servants has applied himself more diligently to
the worship of our gods than I, and nevertheless there
<span class="pln">20</span> are many who receive greater gifts and favors from
thee than I, and are more prosperous in all their undertakings.
I know well that our gods, if they had had
<span class="pb" id="pg_188">[188]</span>
any power, would have rewarded me more because I
have more faithfully served and obeyed them. It seems
<span class="pln">25</span> to me, therefore, wise, if you consider that these new
doctrines which are preached to us are better and more
efficacious, to receive them immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assenting to his words, another of the king&rsquo;s wise
men and chiefs spoke further: &ldquo;O king, this present
<span class="pln">30</span> life of man on earth seems to me, in comparison with
the time that is unknown to us, as if thou wert sitting at
a feast with thine eldermen and thanes in the winter
time, and the fire burned brightly and thy hall was
warm, and it rained and snowed and stormed outside;
<span class="pln">35</span> there comes then a sparrow and flies quickly through
thy house; in through one door he comes, through the
other door he goes out again. As long as he is within
he is not rained on by the winter storm, but after a
twinkling of an eye and a mere moment he goes immediately
<span class="pln">40</span> from winter back to winter again. Likewise
this life of man appeareth for a little time, but what
goes before or what comes after we know not. If therefore
this teaching can tell us anything more satisfying
or certain, it seems worthy to be followed.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>THE VOYAGES OF OHTHERE AND WULFSTAN</h4>
<p class="bq">[From Alfred&rsquo;s version of Orosius&rsquo;s <i>History of the World</i>. Text used:
Bright&rsquo;s <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>, pp. 38 ff.]</p>
<div id="c47a" title="Ohthere&rsquo;s Voyages">
<h5>Ohthere&rsquo;s Voyages</h5>
<p>Ohthere told his lord, King Alfred, that he dwelt the
farthest north of all the Northmen. He said that he
lived in the northern part of the land toward the West
Sea. He reported, however, that the land extended very
<span class="pln">5</span> far north thence; but that it was all waste, except in a
few places here and there where the Finns dwell, engaged
in hunting in winter and sea fishing in summer.
He said that on one occasion he wished to find out how
far the land lay northward, or whether any man inhabited
<span class="pln">10</span> the waste land to the north. Then he fared northward
to the land; for three days there was waste land on
his starboard and the wide sea on his larboard. Then he
had come as far north as the whale hunters ever go.
Whereupon, he journeyed still northward as far as he
<span class="pln">15</span> could in three days sailing. At that place the land bent
to the east&mdash;or the sea in on the land, he knew not which;
but he knew that there he waited for a west wind, or
somewhat from the northwest, and then sailed east, near
the land, as far as he could in four days. There he had to
<span class="pln">20</span> wait for a wind from due north, since there the land
bent due south&mdash;or the sea in on the land, he knew not
<span class="pb" id="pg_190">[190]</span>
which. From there he sailed due south, close in to the
land, as far as he could in five days. At this point a
large river extended up into the land. They then followed
<span class="pln">25</span> this river, for they dared not sail beyond it
because of their fear of hostile reception, the land
being all inhabited on the other side of the river. He
had not found any inhabited land since leaving his own
home; for the land to the right was not inhabited all
<span class="pln">30</span> the way, except by fishermen, fowlers, and hunters, and
these were all Finns; to the left there was always open
sea. The Permians had cultivated their soil very well,
but they dared not enter upon it. The land of the Terfinns
was all waste, except where hunters, fishers, or
<span class="pln">35</span> fowlers dwelt.</p>
<p>The Permians told him many tales both about their
own country and about surrounding countries, but he
knew not how much was true, for he did not behold it for
himself. The Finns and Permians, it appeared to him,
<span class="pln">40</span> spoke almost the same language. He went hither on
this voyage not only for the purpose of seeing the country,
but mainly for walruses, for they have exceedingly
good bone in their teeth&mdash;they brought some of the
teeth to the king&mdash;and their hides are very good for
<span class="pln">45</span> ship-ropes. This whale is much smaller than other
whales; it is not more than seven ells long; but the best
whale-fishing is in his own country&mdash;those are eight
and forty ells long, and the largest are fifty ells long.
He said that he was one of a company of six who killed
<span class="pln">50</span> sixty of these in two days.</p>
<p>Ohthere was a very rich man in such possessions as
<span class="pb" id="pg_191">[191]</span>
make up their wealth, that is, in wild beasts. At the
time when he came to the king, he still had six hundred
tame deer that he had not sold. The men call these
<span class="pln">55</span> reindeer. Six of these were decoy-reindeer, which are
very valuable among the Finns, for it is with them that
the Finns trap the wild reindeer. He was among the
first men in the land, although he had not more than
twenty cattle, twenty sheep, and twenty swine, and the
<span class="pln">60</span> little that he plowed he plowed with horses. Their
income, however, is mainly in the tribute that the Finns
pay them&mdash;animals&rsquo; skins, birds&rsquo; feathers, whalebone,
and ship-ropes made of the hide of whale and the hide
of seal. Every one contributes in proportion to his
<span class="pln">65</span> means; the richest must pay fifteen marten skins and
five reindeer skins; one bear skin, forty bushels of
feathers, a bear-skin or otter-skin girdle, and two ship-ropes,
each sixty ells long, one made of the hide of the
whale and the other of the hide of the seal.</p>
<p> <span class="pln">70</span> He reported that the land of the Northmen was very
long and very narrow. All that man can use for
either grazing or plowing lies near the sea, and even
that is very rocky in some places; and to the east, alongside
the inhabited land, lie wild moors. The Finns live
<span class="pln">75</span> in these waste lands. And the inhabited land is broadest
to the eastward, becoming always narrower the
farther north one goes. To the east it may be sixty
miles broad, or even a little broader; and in the middle
thirty or broader; and to the north, where it was narrowest,
<span class="pln">80</span> he said that it might be three miles broad to the
moor. Moreover the moor is so broad in some places
<span class="pb" id="pg_192">[192]</span>
that it would take a man two weeks to cross it.
In other places it was of such a breadth that a man
can cross it in six days.</p>
<p> <span class="pln">85</span> Then there is alongside that land southward, on the
other side of the moor, Sweden, as far as the land
to the north; and alongside the land northward, the land
of the Cwens (Finns). The Finns plunder the Northmen
over the moor sometimes and sometimes the Northmen
<span class="pln">90</span> plunder them. And there are very many fresh
lakes out over the moor; and the Finns bear their ships
over the land to these lakes and then ravage the Northmen;
they have very small and very light ships.</p>
<p>Ohthere said that the place was called Halgoland, in
<span class="pln">95</span> which he dwelt. He said that no man lived north of
him. There is one port in the southern part of the land
which is called Sciringesheal. Thither he said that one
might not sail in one month, if he encamped by night and
had good wind all day; and all the while he should sail
<span class="pln">100</span> close to land. And on the starboard he has first <a id="frc46_100" href="#fdc46_100">Ireland</a>,
and then the island that is between Ireland and this
land. Then he has this land till he comes to Sciringesheal,
and all the way he has Norway on the larboard.
To the south of Sciringesheal the sea comes far up into
<span class="pln">105</span> the land; the sea is so broad that no man may see
across. And Jutland is in the opposite direction, and
after that is Zealand. The sea runs many hundred
miles up in on that land.</p>
<p>And from Sciringesheal he said that he sailed in five
<span class="pln">110</span> days to that port that is called Haddeby; it lies between
<span class="pb" id="pg_193">[193]</span>
the country of the Wends and the Saxons and the Angles,
and belongs to the Danes. When he sailed away from
Sciringesheal for three days, he had Denmark on the
larboard and the wide sea on his starboard; and then,
<span class="pln">115</span> two days before he reached Haddeby, he had Jutland
on his starboard and also Zealand and many islands. In
that land had dwelt the English before they came hither
to this land. And then for two days he had on his larboard
the islands which belong to Denmark.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef" id="fdc46_100"><a href="#frc46_100">100.</a> <i>Ireland</i>: Iceland is probably meant.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c47b" title="Wulfstan&rsquo;s Voyage">
<h5>Wulfstan&rsquo;s Voyage</h5>
<p> <span class="pln">120</span> Wulfstan said that he set out from Haddeby, and
that he arrived after seven days and nights at Truso,
the ship being all the way under full sail. He had
Wendland (Mecklenburg and Pomerania) on the starboard,
and Langland, Laaland, Falster, and Sconey on
<span class="pln">125</span> the larboard; and all these lands belong to Denmark.
And then we had on our larboard the land of the Burgundians
(Bornholmians), and they have their own
king. Beyond the land of the Burgundians we had on
our left those lands that were first called Blekinge, and
<span class="pln">130</span> Meore, and Oland, and Gothland; these lands belong to
the Swedes. To the starboard we had all the way the
country of the Wends, as far as the mouth of the Vistula.
The Vistula is a very large river, and it separates
Witland from Wendland; and Witland belongs to the
<span class="pln">135</span> Esthonians. The Vistula flows out of Wendland, and
runs into the Frische Haff. The Frische Haff is about
fifteen miles broad. Then the Elbing empties into the
<span class="pb" id="pg_194">[194]</span>
Frische Haff, flowing from the east out of the lake on
the shore of which Truso stands; and there they empty
<span class="pln">140</span> together into the Frische Haff, the Elbing from the
east, which flows out of Esthonia, and the Vistula from
the south, out of Wendland. The Vistula then gives its
name to the Elbing, and runs out of the mere west and
north into the sea; hence it is called the mouth of the
<span class="pln">145</span> Vistula.</p>
<p><a id="frc47_151">Esthonia</a> is very large, and there are many towns
there, and in every town there is a king. There is also
very much honey, and fishing. The king and the richest
men drink mare&rsquo;s milk, but the poor men and the slaves
<span class="pln">150</span> drink mead. There is much strife among them. There
is no ale brewed by the Esthonians; there is, however,
plenty of mead. And there is a custom among the
Esthonians that when a man dies he lies unburied in
his house, with his kindred and friends, for a month&mdash;sometimes
<span class="pln">155</span> two; and the kings and most powerful men
still longer, in proportion to their riches; it is sometimes
half a year that they stay unburnt, lying above
ground, in their own houses. All the time that the body
is within, drinking and merry-making continue until
<span class="pln">160</span> the day that he is burned. The same day on which they
are to bear him to the funeral-pyre they divide his possessions,
whatever may be left after the drinking and
pleasures, into five or six parts&mdash;sometimes into more,
in proportion to the amount of his goods. Then they
<span class="pln">165</span> place the largest share about a mile from the town,
then the second, then the third, until it is all laid within
the one mile; and the smallest portion must be nearest
<span class="pb" id="pg_195">[195]</span>
the town in which the dead man lies. Then there are
gathered together all of the men in the land that have
<span class="pln">170</span> the swiftest horses, about six or seven miles from the
goods. Then they all run toward the possessions, and
the one who has the swiftest horse comes to the first and
largest part, and so one after another till all is taken
up; and the man who arrives at the goods nearest the
<span class="pln">175</span> town obtains the smallest part. Then each man rides
his way with the property, and he may keep it all; and
for this reason fast horses are very dear in that country.
When the property is thus all spent, they bear him
out and burn him along with his weapons and his raiment.
<span class="pln">180</span> And generally they spend all his wealth, with
the long time that the corpse lies within and with the
goods that they lay along the roads, and that the strangers
run for and bear off with them. Again, it is a
custom with the Esthonians to burn men of every tribe,
<span class="pln">185</span> and if any one finds a bone which is unburned he has
to make amends for it. And there is one tribe among
the Esthonians that has the power of making cold, and
it is because they put this cold upon them that the
corpses lie so long and do not decay. And if a man
<span class="pln">190</span> places two vessels full of ale or water, they cause both
to be frozen over, whether it is summer or winter.</p>
